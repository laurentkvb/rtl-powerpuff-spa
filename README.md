### Technologies and methodologies used

* For CSS, the BEM methodology was used to create CSS classes that we're easily to edit and find.
* Axios, for efficiency in API Network requests to the 3rd party backend.
* In the beginning, time was spend to structure the folders in a readable way
* Tried to create the components as flexible and re-usable as possible. This makes the code more readable so less documentation can be used to describe to code.
* Hooks which is praised as best practise
* Redux for state management

### Considerations
- Usage of Typescript for data retrieved from backend, this makes it while developing easier to get the fields required
- unit tests
- pagination
- variables, constants usage for colors, sizes and margins
